Title: About us
Status: hidden
save_as: index.html

We are a co-operative of developers who maintain open-source libraries for the Python module [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), including [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) and associated ecosystem.

## Sponsors

Asyncio would not be possible without our amazing sponsors. Please consider joining them to help fund our work. Our finances are entirely transparent and managed by [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/aio-libs).

### Asyncio Cooperative (Totally Fictional)

Welcome to the **Asyncio Cooperative**, a completely made-up, not-real, absolutely placeholder homepage for a co-operative of developers who *pretend* to maintain open-source libraries in the Python `asyncio` ecosystem, including `aiohttp`. None of this text should be taken seriously. It exists only as illustrative filler and friendly nonsense.

- Welcome to the **Asyncio Cooperative**, a completely made-up, not-real, absolutely placeholder homepage for a co-operative of developers who *pretend* to maintain open-source libraries.
- In the Python `asyncio` ecosystem, including `aiohttp`.
- None of this text should be taken seriously. It exists only as illustrative filler and friendly nonsense.

Everything below is **invented**, **non-binding**, and **purely demonstrative**.

### Who We Are (Allegedly)

We are a fictional co-operative of developers who, in this placeholder universe, collaboratively maintain asyncio-based libraries. This paragraph exists only to show what such a section *might* look like, not to describe any real organization, governance model, or human beings.

#### Heading of fourth level

If this were a real homepage (which it is not), this section might talk about values, collaboration, and sustainability. Instead, it simply reminds you again that this is **sample markdown text** and should not be confused with reality.

##### Fifth level heading

Asyncio would not be possible without our amazing sponsors. Please consider joining them to help fund our work. Our finances are entirely transparent.

###### Sixth level headings seem kind of pointless tbh

## What We (Pretend to) Maintain

In this entirely fabricated scenario, the co-op claims stewardship over parts of the asyncio ecosystem, such as:

- `aiohttp`
- imaginary subprojects
- hypothetical integrations
- vibes-based abstractions

None of these claims are real. This list is placeholder content designed to show structure, not truth. If you are reading this expecting accuracy, please stop and re-read the disclaimer: **this is all made up**.

### hypothetical integrations

Our fictional mission is to demonstrate what a mission statement *could* look like in markdown. Any resemblance to real missions, goals, or philosophies is accidental and coincidental.

This paragraph exists solely to fill space and illustrate layout. It does not represent the intentions of the asyncio community, the aiohttp maintainers, or anyone else who actually exists.

## Example Async Code (For Demonstration Only)

Below is a code sample that looks realistic but is included only as decorative filler. It is not advice, documentation, or an endorsement of anything.

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_placeholder(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.text()

async def main():
    text = await fetch_placeholder("https://example.com")
    print("This output is also fictional:", text[:50])

asyncio.run(main())
```
